Hey there!

In this notebook I'm working on the ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset, which is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

To do so, this is my plan:

1) study the dataset, read relevant scientific literature in the field and make nice visualizations that presents the data;
2) preprocessing, using time series methods;
3) make predictions of the category with unsupervised methods. If possible, I'd like to use image recognition using the picture of the heartbeat and compare the result with the ones obtained with deep neural networks on the dataset.
